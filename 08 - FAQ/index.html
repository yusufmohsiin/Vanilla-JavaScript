    Title: Q&A Section
    Day: 31/100
    Description:
        - This project involves creating a question and answer section that can be useful for many websites to improve their SEO.
        - The final version of the project features three questions, each with a plus sign tab. Clicking on the plus sign shows the answer of the question
        - Nutshell: 
                1- When we click on the plus sign, we'll add an "active" class to the question
                2- Clicking on the minus sign removes the "active" class to hide the answer.
